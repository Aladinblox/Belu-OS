# PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) Module Specifications

This document outlines the specifications for the PDA module, encompassing its core sub-modules: Calendar, Contacts, and Task Management. It details their intended functionality, conceptual API interactions, limitations within an HTML proof-of-concept (POC), and provides hypothetical example entries for each.

## 1. Overall PDA Functionality

The PDA module simulates key features of a Personal Digital Assistant. It aims to provide a user interface for managing:
*   **Calendar:** Tracking appointments and events.
*   **Contacts:** Storing and retrieving contact information.
*   **Task Management:** Organizing and tracking to-do items.

In an HTML POC, these functionalities will be driven by mock data with simplified user interactions.

## 2. Sub-module: Calendar

Manages appointments, events, and time-based reminders.

### 2.1. Calendar Functionality
*   **View Events:**
    *   Display events in a monthly calendar grid.
    *   Days with events should be visually indicated on the month view.
    *   Allow selection of a specific day to view its events in a list format.
*   **Navigate Time:**
    *   Buttons to move to the next and previous month.
    *   Display the current month and year.
*   **(POC Simulated) Add Event:**
    *   Provide a simple form (e.g., inputs for event title, date, time, description).
    *   "Adding" an event updates the internal mock data and refreshes the calendar display.
*   **(POC Simulated) View Event Details:**
    *   Clicking an event (either on the day view or a summary in month view) displays its full details.
*   **(Optional for POC) Week View:** A simplified weekly view of events.

### 2.2. Calendar Conceptual API (e.g., `pda.calendar`)
*   `setInitialEvents(eventsArray: Array<Object>)`: (POC specific) Loads initial mock event data.
    *   `eventsArray` contains event objects.
*   `getEventsForMonth(year: number, month: number): Array<Object>`: Returns events for the specified month.
*   `getEventsForDay(date: string): Array<Object>`: Returns events for a specific date (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD").
*   `addEvent(eventData: Object): void`: (POC) Adds a mock event to the internal data. `eventData` includes title, date, time, description.
*   `onEventSelect(callback: Function)`: Callback triggered when an event is selected. Passes event details to the callback.
*   `onDateSelect(callback: Function)`: Callback triggered when a date is selected on the calendar. Passes the date to the callback.

### 2.3. Example Calendar Entries
*   `{ id: "evt1", title: "Team Meeting", date: "2024-07-15", time: "10:00", description: "Discuss project updates for Q3." }`
*   `{ id: "evt2", title: "Doctor's Appointment", date: "2024-07-18", time: "14:30", description: "Annual check-up with Dr. Smith." }`

## 4. Sub-module: Task Management (To-Do List)

Helps users organize, track, and manage their tasks.

### 4.1. Task Management Functionality
*   **View Tasks:** Display a list of tasks, each showing its description and status (e.g., "pending", "completed").
*   **(POC Simulated) Add Task:**
    *   A simple input field for the task description.
    *   New tasks are added with a "pending" status and (optionally) a due date or priority.

## 5. Overall PDA Conceptual API Interactions (e.g., `pda` main module)

*   `pda.init(initialData: { calendar?: Array<Object>, contacts?: Array<Object>, tasks?: Array<Object> })`:
    *   Initializes all sub-modules with their respective data if provided.
    *   Calls `setInitialEvents`, `setInitialContacts`, `setInitialTasks` internally.
*   `pda.navigateToSection(sectionName: string, params?: Object)`:
    *   Used to switch the main view between "Calendar", "Contacts", and "Tasks".
    *   `params` could be used for deep linking, e.g., `pda.navigateToSection("Calendar", { view: "day", date: "2024-07-15" })`.
*   `pda.getActiveSection(): string`: Returns the name of the currently visible section ("Calendar", "Contacts", or "Tasks").

## 6. Limitations for HTML Proof-of-Concept (General to PDA)

*   **Data Persistence:** All data is ephemeral and stored in JavaScript variables. Data will be lost on page refresh unless browser LocalStorage is implemented as an extension.
*   **Simplified UI/UX:** User interface elements and interactions will be basic to simplify POC development (e.g., no rich text editors, complex date pickers, or drag-and-drop reordering).
*   **No Backend Integration:** The module is entirely client-side and does not communicate with any server or external services.
*   **No Real-time Features:** No real-time updates, collaboration, or synchronization capabilities.
*   **Notifications & Reminders:** The POC will not generate system-level notifications or alarms.
*   **Authentication & Users:** The system is designed for a single, anonymous user session. No login or multi-user support.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling; the focus is on demonstrating core functionality ("happy path").
*   **Search/Filter Scope:** Search and filter operations will be client-side and limited to simple matching on the mock data.
