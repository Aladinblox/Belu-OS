# Paint Application Module Specifications

This document outlines the specifications for the Paint Application module. It covers its intended functionality, conceptual API interactions, limitations within an HTML proof-of-concept (POC), and a description of its hypothetical user interface.

## 1. Overall Paint Application Functionality

The Paint Application module provides a basic web-based digital drawing environment. Users can create simple graphical images using a selection of drawing tools, colors, and brush sizes on a digital canvas. The HTML POC will focus on core drawing mechanics, with save/load operations being simulated or highly simplified.

## 2. Core Functionality Details

### 2.1. Canvas
*   **Drawing Surface:** A designated rectangular area on the web page where all drawing operations occur.
*   **Dimensions:** Fixed dimensions for the POC (e.g., 800px width, 600px height).
*   **Background:** Defaults to a solid color (e.g., white). Content is drawn on top of this background.

### 2.2. Drawing Tools
*   **Pencil/Brush:**
    *   Primary tool for freehand drawing.
    *   Uses the currently selected color and brush size.
    *   Draws a continuous line as the user clicks and drags the mouse.
*   **Eraser:**
    *   Removes previously drawn content.
    *   Effectively "draws" with the canvas background color (or makes pixels transparent if advanced transparency is implemented, though likely background color for POC).
    *   Uses the currently selected brush size to determine the erased area.
*   **(Optional for POC) Line Tool:**
    *   Draws a straight line between two points.
    *   User clicks to set the start point, drags, and releases to set the end point.
    *   Uses the selected color and brush size (for line thickness).
*   **(Optional for POC) Shape Tools (e.g., Rectangle, Circle):**
    *   **Rectangle:** Defined by a drag operation from one corner to the opposite.
    *   **Circle:** Defined by a drag operation (e.g., center to a point on the circumference).
    *   Shapes can be outline or filled (for POC, filled might be simpler, or outline-only). Uses selected color.

### 2.3. Color Selection
*   **Palette:** A predefined set of basic colors (e.g., black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple).
*   **Selection:** User clicks on a color in the palette to set it as the active drawing color.
*   **Indicator:** A visual element (e.g., a larger square) displays the currently selected color.

### 2.4. Brush/Tool Size
*   **Options:** A mechanism to change the size (thickness) of the drawing tools (Pencil, Eraser, Line).
    *   Could be predefined options (e.g., "Small", "Medium", "Large") or a slider control for pixel values (e.g., 2px, 5px, 10px).
*   **Indicator:** Visual feedback for the currently selected brush size.

### 2.5. Actions
*   **Clear Canvas:** A button or command that removes all drawing from the canvas, resetting it to its initial blank state (background color).
*   **(POC Simulated) Save Image:**
    *   A button that simulates the action of saving the current canvas content.
    *   In a full implementation, this would ideally trigger `canvas.toDataURL()` and prompt a download of the image (e.g., as a PNG file).
    *   For the POC, it might log a message to the console or display a simple notification.
*   **(POC Simulated) Load Image:**
    *   A button that simulates loading an image onto the canvas.
    *   In a full implementation, this would involve a file input for the user to select an image from their device.
    *   For the POC, this is likely out of scope, or could "load" a predefined mock image/drawing if implemented.

## 3. Conceptual API Interactions (e.g., `paintApp` module)

*   `paintApp.init(canvasHTMLElement: HTMLCanvasElement, config?: Object)`:
    *   Initializes the paint application, associating it with a given `<canvas>` DOM element.
    *   `config` could specify initial color, tool, brush size, or canvas dimensions (if dynamic).
*   `paintApp.setTool(toolName: string)`:
    *   Sets the active drawing tool (e.g., `"pencil"`, `"eraser"`, `"line"`, `"rectangle"`).
*   `paintApp.setColor(colorValue: string)`:
    *   Sets the active drawing color (e.g., `"#FF0000"`, `"blue"`).
*   `paintApp.setBrushSize(size: number)`:
    *   Sets the size of the brush/tool in pixels (e.g., `2`, `5`, `10`).
*   `paintApp.clearCanvas()`:
    *   Executes the "Clear Canvas" action.
*   `paintApp.getCanvasAsDataURL(): string`:
    *   Returns a Base64 encoded data URL of the canvas content (e.g., `image/png`). This is the core for actual saving.
*   `paintApp.saveImage()`:
    *   (POC) Triggers the simulated save process. Internally might call `getCanvasAsDataURL()`.
*   `paintApp.loadImage(imageDataUrl?: string)`:
    *   (POC) Simulates loading. If `imageDataUrl` is provided, it could (conceptually) draw this image onto the canvas. In a POC, this might draw a hardcoded image.
*   `paintApp.onStateChange(callback: Function)`:
    *   A generic callback that could be triggered when tool, color, or brush size changes, passing an object with the current state.

## 4. Limitations for HTML Proof-of-Concept

*   **Performance:** Drawing complex images with many paths or on very large canvases can become slow, as all rendering is done client-side in the browser.
*   **Advanced Drawing Features:**
    *   **No Layers:** All drawing occurs on a single layer.
    *   **No Text Tool:** Adding text is not supported.
    *   **No Complex Shapes/Paths:** Only basic lines and potentially simple geometric shapes. No Bezier curves or complex path editing.
    *   **No Selection Tools:** Tools like lasso, marquee select are not included.
    *   **No Image Filters/Effects:** Transformations, filters, or effects are out of scope.
*   **Undo/Redo:** A comprehensive undo/redo stack (saving multiple canvas states) is complex and will likely be omitted or limited to a single-step undo at most.
*   **File Operations:**
    *   **Saving:** While `canvas.toDataURL()` makes image data accessible, the POC's "Save" will be simulated. Full "Save As" dialogs depend on browser capabilities and user interaction. Saving application-specific project files (with layers, history) is not feasible.
    *   **Loading:** Loading external images from a user's file system requires a file input and FileReader API, which might be simplified or omitted in the POC ("loading" a pre-defined image).
*   **Touch Input:** Basic touch events might work for drawing, but optimizing for a smooth, feature-rich touch interface (e.g., pinch-zoom, two-finger pan) is beyond the scope of a simple POC.
*   **UI Sophistication:** The user interface will be functional but basic, lacking the polish and extensive options of professional paint software.

## 5. Hypothetical Interface Description

The Paint Application would be presented as a single-page interface with distinct areas:

*   **Central Canvas Area:**
    *   The largest part of the interface, a rectangular HTML5 canvas element, initially blank (e.g., white). This is the active drawing surface.

*   **Toolbar Panel (typically positioned to the left or top of the canvas):**
    *   **Tool Selection:**
        *   A set of icon buttons for tools: "Pencil", "Eraser".
        *   (Optional: "Line", "Rectangle", "Circle" if implemented).
        *   The currently active tool would have a visually distinct state (e.g., highlighted or pressed).
    *   **Color Palette:**
        *   A grid of clickable color swatches (e.g., 2 rows of 6 colors each, including black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, etc.).
        *   A larger swatch that displays the currently selected drawing color.
    *   **Brush Size Control:**
        *   A set of buttons representing different brush thicknesses (e.g., "S", "M", "L") or a simple horizontal slider.
        *   Visual indication of the current selection.
    *   **Action Buttons:**
        *   "Clear": A button to reset the canvas.
        *   "Save (Sim)": A button to trigger the simulated save operation.
        *   "Load (Sim)": (If implemented) A button to trigger simulated image loading.

**Example Interaction Flow:**
1.  The application loads. The canvas is white. Default tool is "Pencil", color is "black", size is "medium".
2.  User clicks the "Blue" swatch in the Color Palette. The current color indicator updates to blue.
3.  User selects the "Pencil" tool (if not already selected).
4.  User clicks and drags their mouse on the canvas. A blue line of medium thickness appears.
5.  User clicks the "Eraser" tool.
6.  User selects the "Large" brush size.
7.  User drags the mouse over the blue line. The parts of the line under the large eraser cursor are removed (turn white).
8.  User clicks the "Clear" button. The entire canvas becomes white.
9.  User clicks "Save (Sim)". A browser alert "Image saved (simulated)" might appear, or a message in the console.
